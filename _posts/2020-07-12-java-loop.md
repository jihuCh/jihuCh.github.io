1. for
2. while

__for__  
ex:
```java
for(int i = 0; i<10; i++){
    //조건이 true일 경우 실행
}
```
- 10보다 작을때 실행.
- 'In computer science, a for-loop is a control flow statement for specifying iteration, which allows code to be executed repeatedly.' --Google
- loops a code until it's smaller than 10.
  
__while__
ex:
```java
int i=0  //변수 선언
while(i<10){ //괄호 안에 조건 넣어주기 
   i++ //도와주는 변수 업데이트
}
``` 
- 'In most computer programming languages, a while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition.'--Google
- Code inside while loop would be executed until the condition is false.
