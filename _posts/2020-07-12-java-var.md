Q. What is a variable in computer science?  
A. 'In computer programming, a variable or scalar is a   storage location paired with an associated symbolic name,   which contains some known or unknown quantity of information   referred to as a value.' --Google  
In other words, a variable is a location where you can simply   store values or informations.   </p>

How to use 
1. Make Class file(File name must start in capital letter)  
System.out.print = Outputs data in console(basically printing without enter)  
3. System.out.print = Outputs data with enter automatically  
  
- Use plus(+) to connect two strings  
- How to create files: Click NEW -> class -> make name.  
- Command+A = Highlight all  
- Command + Shift + F =  arranges line  
- Command + S = Save  
  
- Type: scanner -> System.in import  
- Scanner **name** <- file name  
- nextInt: User gets to input information  
- input.next()  
- input.nextDouble() <- For real numbers  
- input.nextBoolean <- True/False  
- method = function(함수)


    Why did we use these specific parameters during the calculation of the fingerprints?
